# MLOps Maturity Model

## 1. Purpose of a Maturity Model

A maturity model provides a structured framework to assess and incrementally improve an organization’s ML operations,
identifying gaps and guiding investments :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}.

## 2. Typical Stages

Based on Microsoft’s five-stage model and recent research :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:

1. **Ad hoc**
    - Manual data prep, training, and deployment
    - No formal processes or tooling
2. **DataOps**
    - Automated data pipelines
    - Versioned datasets
3. **Manual MLOps**
    - Scripts for model training and deployment
    - Some version control of code and models
4. **Automated MLOps**
    - CI/CD for data, models, and code
    - Automated retraining and redeployment
5. **Kaizen MLOps**
    - Continuous improvement loops
    - Advanced monitoring (data drift, model explainability)

## 3. Microsoft’s Maturity Pillars

- **People & Collaboration**: Cross-functional teams and clear roles
- **Process & Governance**: Standardized workflows, compliance
- **Platform & Architecture**: Scalable infrastructure, feature stores
- **Automation & Orchestration**: End-to-end pipelines

## 4. Assessing Your State

- Conduct workshops to map current practices to model levels
- Identify quick wins (e.g., automate one pipeline)
- Set roadmap for maturity increments

## 5. Benefits of Advancement

- **Risk Mitigation**: Early detection of model drift and failures
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced manual toil, faster iterations
- **Business Impact**: More reliable, explainable, and auditable ML services :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.
