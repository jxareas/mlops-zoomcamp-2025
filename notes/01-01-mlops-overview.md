# MLOps Overview

## 1. Definition and Scope

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of applying DevOps principles to ML systems—bridging the gap between
model development and production operations. It encompasses the full lifecycle: data preparation, model training,
validation, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Iterative–Incremental Development**: Build and refine models in small, fast cycles to accommodate evolving data and
  requirements :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
- **Automation & CI/CD**: Automate data ingestion, model training, testing, and deployment pipelines to reduce manual
  errors and accelerate release cycles :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
- **Versioning**: Track versions of code, data, configurations, and models to ensure traceability and rollback
  capabilities :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
- **Testing & Validation**: Integrate automated unit, integration, and model performance tests to catch regressions
  early :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
- **Reproducibility**: Guarantee that experiments yield the same results when rerun by systematically managing
  environments and dependencies :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Continuously monitor model health (e.g., data drift, performance decay) in production
  and trigger alerts for anomalies :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.

## 3. Typical Toolchain

- **Source Control**: Git (GitHub, GitLab)
- **Environment Management**: Conda, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Kubeflow, Argo
- **Experiment Management**: MLflow, Weights & Biases
- **Feature Stores**: Feast, Tecton
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Seldon Core

## 4. Benefits

- **Faster Time–to–Market** via automated pipelines
- **Improved Collaboration** between data scientists and engineers
- **Higher Reliability** through standardized processes
- **Scalability** for large volumes of data and models
